Morganucodon;Omnivore;:/animalP/img/animals/Morganucodon.png;Morganucodon was a small, early mammalia form that lived approximately <br>205 million years ago during the Late Triassic to Early Jurassic periods. <br>Resembling a shrew or mouse, it had a skull length of 2–3 cm and a body <br>length of about 10 cm. Evidence suggests it possessed fur and was likely <br> nocturnal, inhabiting burrows and feeding on insects and small animals.<br>Its dental structure indicates it had deciduous teeth replaced by permanent <br>ones, a trait associated with lactation, implying it may have been among the <br>first animals to nurse their young. <br>;Mammalia;N/A;Morganucodon
Hesperocyon;Carnivore;:/animalP/img/animals/Hesperocyon.png;Hesperocyon was an early member of the Canidae family, inhabiting North<br> America from the Late Eocene to Early Oligocene epochs, approximately <br>42 to 31 million years ago. Resembling a modern civet or small raccoon, it <br>measured about 80 cm in length, with a long, flexible body and tail, short<br>legs, and five-toed feet. Its dental structure featured 42 teeth, including<br>carnassial teeth adapted for meat consumption, indicating a primarily<br>carnivorous diet. Hesperocyon is considered a basal canid, ancestral to later<br>subfamilies such as Borophaginae and Caninae, leading to present-day <br>dogs, wolves, and foxes.;Mammalia;Canidae;Hesperocyon
Edwardii;Carnivore;:/animalP/img/animals/Edwardii.png;Canis edwardii, commonly known as Edward's wolf, was an extinct species<br>of wolf that inhabited North America approximately 2.3 million to 300,000<br>years ago, spanning the Late Blancan stage of the Pliocene epoch to the<br>Irvingtonian stage of the Pleistocene epoch. This species was named by<br>paleontologist Charles Gazin in 1942. Edward's wolf was a carnivorous<br>predator, preying on various herbivorous mammals of its time. Fossil<br>evidence indicates that Canis edwardii was widespread across North <br>America during its existence.The extinction of Edward's wolf occurred<br> around 300,000 years ago, marking the end of its lineage.<br>;Mammalia;Canidae;Canis
Riffautae;Carnivore;:/animalP/img/animals/Vulpes.png;Vulpes riffautae was an extinct species of fox that lived in Chad around<br>7 million years ago during the Late Miocene. It is considered one of the<br>earliest representatives of the Canidae family in the Old World. The species <br>was intermediate in size between the Rüppell's fox (Vulpes rueppellii) and <br>the fennec fox (Vulpes zerda). Fossils of V. riffautae provide crucial<br> evidence for the early evolution of the fox lineage.;Mammalia;Canidae;Vulpes
Sahelanthropus tchadensis;Omnivore;:/animalP/img/animals/Sahelanthropus_tchadensis.png;Sahelanthropus tchadensis is one of the earliest known hominins, dating<br>back about 7 million years ago. Discovered in Chad, it is considered to be<br>one of the oldest species on the human evolutionary tree. Sahelanthropus<br> had a small brain size, similar to modern chimpanzees, but its face showed<br> signs of bipedalism. Its mix of ape-like and human-like traits makes it a <br> key species in the study of human evolution.<br>;Mammalia;Hominidae;Sahelanthropus
Paniscus;Omnivore;:/animalP/img/animals/Paniscus.png;Paniscus pan, also known as the bonobo, is a species of great ape closely<br>related to the chimpanzee. Native to the rainforests of the Democratic<br>Republic of Congo, bonobos are known for their peaceful and matriarchal<br>social structure. They are characterized by a black face, darker skin, and <br>long, dark hair. Bonobos are highly intelligent, using tools and exhibiting<br>complex social behaviors like cooperation and empathy.<br>;Mammalia;Hominidae;Pan
Habilis;Omnivore;:/animalP/img/animals/Habilis.png;Homo habilis is an extinct species of early humans that lived approximately<br>2.4 to 1.4 million years ago during the Pleistocene epoch. It is considered<br>one of the first members of the genus Homo. Characterized by a relatively<br> larger brain than earlier hominids. Habilis is believed to have used simple<br> stone tools and had a more advanced ability to adapt to different <br>environments compared to earlier species. It is considered a key ancestor of <br>modern humans.;Mammalia;Hominidae;Homo
Proailurus;Carnivore;:/animalP/img/animals/Proailurus.png;Proailurus is an extinct genus of carnivorous mammals that lived during<br>the late Oligocene and early Miocene, around 25 to 20 million years ago.<br>It is considered to be one of the earliest members of the Felidae family,<br>which includes modern cats. Proailurus had a small, weasel-like body and<br>likely hunted small vertebrates. Its fossil remains suggest it had retractable<br>claws, an important trait seen in modern cats.<br>;Mammalia;Felidae;Proailurus
Blytheae;Carnivore;:/animalP/img/animals/Blytheae.png;Blytheae is an extinct genus of carnivorous mammals that is considered an<br>ancestor of the Panthera genus, which includes modern big cats like lions,<br>tigers, and leopards. It lived during the late Eocene to early Oligocene,<br>around 40 to 30 million years ago. Blytheae had characteristics that suggest<br>it was an early member of the Felidae family. Its fossil remains provide<br>important evidence for the evolution of large cats in the Panthera lineage.;Mammalia;Felidae;Panthera
Silvestris;Carnivore;:/animalP/img/animals/Silvestris.png;Felis silvestris, the wildcat, is considered the ancestor of the modern <br>domestic cat (Felis catus). It diverged from the lineage of domestic cats<br>around 2 to 3 million years ago. The wildcat's ancestors were larger and<br>more territorial than modern house cats. Felis silvestris played an important<br>role in the domestication of cats, as it likely attracted human settlements<br>by hunting pests, leading to the mutual relationship that resulted in<br>domestication.<br>;Mammalia;Felidae;Felis
