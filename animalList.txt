Morganucodon;Omnivore;:/animalP/img/animals/Morganucodon.png;Morganucodon was a small, early mammaliaform that lived approximately <br>205 million years ago during the Late Triassic to Early Jurassic periods. <br>Resembling a shrew or mouse, it had a skull length of 2–3 cm and a body <br>length of about 10 cm. Evidence suggests it possessed fur and was <br>likely nocturnal, inhabiting burrows and feeding on insects and small <br>animals. Its dental structure indicates it had deciduous teeth replaced <br>by permanent ones, a trait associated with lactation, implying it may <br>have been among the first animals to nurse their young. <br>;Mammalia;N/A;Morganucodon
Hesperocyon;Carnivore;:/animalP/img/animals/Hesperocyon.png;Hesperocyon was an early member of the Canidae family, inhabiting North America<br>from the Late Eocene to Early Oligocene epochs, approximately 42 to 31 million<br>years ago. Resembling a modern civet or small raccoon, it measured about 80 cm<br>in length, with a long, flexible body and tail, short legs, and five-toed feet.<br>Its dental structure featured 42 teeth, including carnassial teeth adapted for<br>meat consumption, indicating a primarily carnivorous diet. Hesperocyon is<br>considered a basal canid, ancestral to later subfamilies such as Borophaginae<br>and Caninae, leading to present-day dogs, wolves, and foxes.<br>;Mammalia;Canidae;Hesperocyon
Edwardii;Carnivore;:/animalP/img/animals/Edwardii.png;Canis edwardii, commonly known as Edward's wolf, was an extinct species of wolf<br>that inhabited North America approximately 2.3 million to 300,000 years ago,<br>spanning the Late Blancan stage of the Pliocene epoch to the Irvingtonian<br>stage of the Pleistocene epoch. This species was named by paleontologist<br>Charles Gazin in 1942. Edward's wolf was a carnivorous predator, preying on<br>various herbivorous mammals of its time. Fossil evidence indicates that<br>Canis edwardii was widespread across North America during its existence.<br>The extinction of Edward's wolf occurred around 300,000 years ago, marking<br>the end of its lineage.<br>;Mammalia;Canidae;Canis
Riffautae;Carnivore;:/animalP/img/animals/Vulpes.png;Vulpes riffautae was an extinct species of fox that lived in Chad around<br>7 million years ago during the Late Miocene. It is considered one of th<br>e earliest representatives of the Canidae family in the Old World. The s<br>pecies was intermediate in size between the Rüppell's fox (Vulpes rueppe<br>llii) and the fennec fox (Vulpes zerda). Fossils of V. riffautae provide<br>crucial evidence for the early evolution of the fox lineage.;Mammalia;Canidae;Vulpes
Sahelanthropus tchadensis;Omnivore;:/animalP/img/animals/Sahelanthropus_tchadensis.png;Sahelanthropus tchadensis is one of the earliest known hominins, dating back about<br>7 million years ago. Discovered in Chad, it is considered to be one of the<br>oldest species on the human evolutionary tree. Sahelanthropus had a small<br>brain size, similar to modern chimpanzees, but its face showed signs of<br>bipedalism. Its mix of ape-like and human-like traits makes it a key<br>species in the study of human evolution.<br>;Mammalia;Hominidae;Sahelanthropus
Paniscus;Omnivore;:/animalP/img/animals/Paniscus.png;Paniscus pan, also known as the bonobo, is a species of great ape closely related<br>to the chimpanzee. Native to the rainforests of the Democratic Republic of Congo,<br>bonobos are known for their peaceful and matriarchal social structure. They are<br>characterized by a black face, darker skin, and long, dark hair. Bonobos are<br>highly intelligent, using tools and exhibiting complex social behaviors like<br>cooperation and empathy.<br>;Mammalia;Hominidae;Pan
Habilis;Omnivore;:/animalP/img/animals/Habilis.png;Homo habilis is an extinct species of early humans that lived approximat<br>ely 2.4 to 1.4 million years ago during the Pleistocene epoch. It is con<br>sidered one of the first members of the genus Homo. Characterized by a r<br>elatively larger brain than earlier hominids, H. habilis is believed to <br>have used simple stone tools and had a more advanced ability to adapt to<br> different environments compared to earlier species. It is considered a <br>key ancestor of modern humans.;Mammalia;Hominidae;Homo
Proailurus;Carnivore;:/animalP/img/animals/Proailurus.png;Proailurus is an extinct genus of carnivorous mammals that lived during the late<br>Oligocene and early Miocene, around 25 to 20 million years ago. It is considered<br>to be one of the earliest members of the Felidae family, which includes modern<br>cats. Proailurus had a small, weasel-like body and likely hunted small<br>vertebrates. Its fossil remains suggest it had retractable claws, an<br>important trait seen in modern cats.<br>;Mammalia;Felidae;Proailurus
Blytheae;Carnivore;:/animalP/img/animals/Blytheae.png;Blytheae is an extinct genus of carnivorous mammals that is considered an ancestor<br>of the Panthera genus, which includes modern big cats like lions, tigers,<br>and leopards. It lived during the late Eocene to early Oligocene, around<br>40 to 30 million years ago. Blytheae had characteristics that suggest it<br>was an early member of the Felidae family. Its fossil remains provide<br>important evidence for the evolution of large cats in the Panthera lineage.<br>;Mammalia;Felidae;Panthera
Silvestris;Carnivore;:/animalP/img/animals/Silvestris.png;Felis silvestris, the wildcat, is considered the ancestor of the modern domestic<br>cat (Felis catus). It diverged from the lineage of domestic cats around<br>2 to 3 million years ago. The wildcat's ancestors were larger and<br>more territorial than modern house cats. Felis silvestris played an<br>important role in the domestication of cats, as it likely attracted<br>human settlements by hunting pests, leading to the mutual relationship<br>that resulted in domestication.<br>;Mammalia;Felidae;Felis
